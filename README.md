## Intro

Currently, UChicago Dining provides one days worth of meal information. It is unorganized and difficult to search for meals as well as determine when and at what dining halls these meals can be found. Moreover, while they have meal data for future days, it is not easily available for users to look at. We thus take their data and provide search features that enable selections of time and dining halls along with a meal search. Meals can be added and then tracked on the Macros page where the user can assess their ideal Macronutrient goals for balancing their weight along with the Macros of their selected meals. Finally, on the Predict page, users can plan ahead and search for future meal availabilities.

## How we built it

We used python for querying UChicago's dining API's to create jsons to represent the food offerings of each day. We then used the created jsons, material ui library, and react to create the frontend. We used a personal ubuntu apache webserver to host.

## Future updates

We hope to build a flask or express backend api to store the jsons to improve website load time as well as allow for user account creation. We also hope to improve the frontend to include more macros visualization
